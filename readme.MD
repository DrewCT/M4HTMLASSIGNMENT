This is my "Shoe Store" Website! I incorporated all the information I learned from the previous 4 lessons! 

I noticed the trend of adding more and more stuff in this assignment, so I made it my own by structuring it in a way that I thought made sense! You can find the first step in the "Contact" page as well as the required image as a placeholder on the "About" page. I also added additional features like iframe to show you one of the shoes we have in our inventory (tables). Lastly, I incorporated the survey at the bottom of the home screen.
